    <h3>Steps</h3>     
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
                      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 2</strong>
                      Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
                      Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 4</strong>
                      Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 5</strong>
                      Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
                      Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Step 7</strong>
                      Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes
